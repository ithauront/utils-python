# 🧰 Python Utilities

This repository contains a small collection of utility functions written in Python, along with comprehensive tests using `pytest`. These utilities cover everyday tasks such as parsing dynamic routes, extracting data from query strings, and converting Brazilian postal codes (CEP) to city and state using the ViaCEP API.
